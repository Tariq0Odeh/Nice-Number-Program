# [Nice Number Programming](/Nice Number Programming.pdf)
Welcome to the Ant Searching for Food Simulation project! This project aims to simulate the behavior of a group of ants in search of food. The simulation is designed to be simple yet engaging, providing an opportunity to observe the collective behavior of ants.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a multi-threaded simulation of ants searching for food. By leveraging multi-threading, our aim is to achieve a more efficient and realistic simulation that accurately represents the behavior of ants in their natural environment. Each ant is represented by a separate thread, enabling concurrent execution and independent movement of multiple ants. This implementation allows us to simulate complex behaviors, such as food detection, pheromone release, and coordinated movements toward food sources. With the use of threads, we can create an engaging and dynamic simulation that closely mimics the intricate behaviors observed in real ants during their search for food.

## Description
- [Project Description](/project3_threads.pdf)

 ## How
 - Clone the repository to your local machine.
 - In terminal:  </br>
1- Make sure you have the libfreetype6-dev library installed   </br>
  ```
 sudo apt update
 sudo apt install libfreetype6-dev
 ```
&emsp; &ensp; 2- Then you can run the program using:

 ```
 cd POSIX-threads-under-linux/src
 make
 make run
 ```
 - By observing the simulation on the OpenGL screen, you can gain insights into the collective behavior of the ants, their coordination in locating food, and the propagation of social responses through pheromones.

## Configuration
You can customize the following parameters in the source code:

* Number of ants
* Speed limit for ants
* Number of initial directions
* Change direction angle: *Ant turning angle when hitting the wall*
* Small angle: *Ant turning angle when smelling weak pheromones*
* Food dwell time *Time between each food spawn*
* Ant smell distance: *Distance at which ants can smell food*
* Weak pheromone threshold
* Strong pheromone threshold
* Ant appetite: *Portion of food in percent that an ant eats in one second*
* Run time: *Simulation duration*
* Number of food pieces spawned in each round

##### Notes:
* A pheromone threshold over 32 disables the effect completely
* A smell distance over 4 will allow ants to smell food across the entire screen

Feel free to modify these parameters in **conf.txt** to suit your specific needs.</br>
